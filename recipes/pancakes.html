    <p>These pancakes are an Oreo lover's dream. Crush up your cookies and add them to the batter. Stack your pancakes with cream cheese mousse in between, and drizzle vanilla sauce on top with more cookie crumbs. Serve with a glass of cold milk for the full experience.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
       <li>6 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
       <li>1/2 cups white sugar</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
       <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
       <li>3/4 cup heavy cream, divided</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Vanilla Drizzle:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pancakes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 Cookies, chocolate sandwich, with extra creme filling</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 cups whole buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/4 cup cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking often, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Chill, uncovered, until cooled completely, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining 1/2 cup cream with an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Fold whipped cream into the cooled cream cheese mixture. Spoon into a piping bag, and chill until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Whisk powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla for vanilla drizzle in a medium bowl. Cover until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Crush chocolate sandwich cookies and set aside</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla in a large measuring cup; pour over dry ingredients. Gently stir until almost incorporated. Drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle with 2 cups crushed cookies. Stir until just incorporated and some lumps remain. Let batter rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 2/3 cup batter onto the griddle for each pancake, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Let cook, undisturbed, until bubbles rise to the surface and edges look dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Place 1 pancake on a plate and top with 3 tablespoons of the mousse. Repeat layers twice, and top with a fourth pancake. Repeat with remaining pancakes and mousse. Top each pancake stack with vanilla drizzle and remaining mousse. Sprinkle with remaining crushed cookies.</li>
    </ol>
